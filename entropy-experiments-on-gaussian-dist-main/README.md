# Proof of the entropy of the gaussian distribution

Entropy experiments on the gaussian distribution changing mean and variance values.<br>
The entropy of a Gaussian variable only depends on its variance. <br>

- Experiment 1: Negatif entropy in the gaussian distribution <br>
- Experiment 2: Effect of the variance on the entropy of a gaussian distribution <br>
